# Polygon Area Calculator

This is the fourth project out of five that I completed as part of the 'Scientific Computing with Python' course from freeCodeCamp. For this project, I worked on Replit using their test code to develop a class and a subclass. The Rectangle class has methods that calculate the area, diagonal, and perimeter of a rectangle. The user can also change the original width or height. Another method allows drawing a picture on the screen of the given rectangle (with '*'). There is also a final method that takes another shape (square or rectangle) as an argument and returns the number of times the passed in shape could fit inside the shape (with no rotations).

The Square subclass inherits every method fron the Rectangle class with the addition of the 'set_side' method, which allows the user to change the original side of the square.
